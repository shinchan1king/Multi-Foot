## Multi-Foot
This is a multiplayer Football 3D Game Made in C# IN UNITY 
FIRST OF I HAVE  USED ADOBE FUSE FOR MAKING A PLAYER
THEN I USE 3D MODELS OF FOOTBALL STADIUM NETS ETC 
THEN I USED MIXAMO ANIMATIONS FOR THE PLAYER'S MOVEMENT
THEN COMBINE ALL OF THEM TO MAKE A BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE GAME
AND THEN I USED THE UNITY PHOTON ASSET FOR CONNECTING REAL PLAYERS AROUND THE WORLD
IN WHICH I HAD MADE A ROOM CARD IN WHICH 20 PEOPLE CAN JOIN AND THEN START THE GAME
AND AFTER THAT I DEFINED THE BASIC RULES OF THE GAME ONLY ONE RULE THAT I AM NOT USISNG HERE IS PENALITY KICK
AND THE TIMER OF THE GAME IS 15 MINUTES AFTER THAT THE GAME WILL AUTOMATICALLY END
ALSO THERE IS VOICE OPTION IN WHICH PLAYERS CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER

SO this is a basic demonstartion of the game 
first if we start the game we will see this type of screen

if we click on create room it will give me this type of screen

Now if we create new room 
we will see this type of screen

if we go on find room on another user we will see this type of screen

If we join that room we can change our role to any empty position like attacker defender and goalkeeper

Now we can see user 2 doesn't have the permission to start the game only admin can start the game if admin leaves then the next user will be the admin

NoW after starting the game we can see this type of screen from both user

The player has certain type of moves like pass chip throw in etc 
the goalkeeper would have all the player moves but jhas some additional moves to catch the ball within ceratin limit of  the area
The rules are also defined for throw in and hand touched etc.
