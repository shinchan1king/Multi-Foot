# Multi-Foot
This is a multiplayer Football 3D Game Made in C# IN UNITY 
FIRST OF I HAVE  USED ADOBE FUSE FOR MAKING A PLAYER
THEN I USE 3D MODELS OF FOOTBALL STADIUM NETS ETC 
THEN I USED MIXAMO ANIMATIONS FOR THE PLAYER'S MOVEMENT
THEN COMBINE ALL OF THEM TO MAKE A BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE GAME
AND THEN I USED THE UNITY PHOTON ASSET FOR CONNECTING REAL PLAYERS AROUND THE WORLD
IN WHICH I HAD MADE A ROOM CARD IN WHICH 20 PEOPLE CAN JOIN AND THEN START THE GAME
AND AFTER THAT I DEFINED THE BASIC RULES OF THE GAME ONLY ONE RULE THAT I AM NOT USISNG HERE IS PENALITY KICK
AND THE TIMER OF THE GAME IS 15 MINUTES AFTER THAT THE GAME WILL AUTOMATICALLY END;
